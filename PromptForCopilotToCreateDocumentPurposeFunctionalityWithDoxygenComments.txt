To get code documentation for Purpose & Functionality + methods commented with doxygen comments:

 

1-Use agent mode of copilot

2-Change the model from GPT 4.1 to Claude Sonnet 4

3- Use this prompt:

Explain the complete purpose and functionality in detail of the code in walgreensserver.pl and walgreensserverlibrary.pl and add to a markdown document named PurposeAndFunctionality.md.  Also add Doxygen-style docstrings to every function and method, describing their purpose, parameters, return values, and exception conditions for walgreensserver.pl and walgreensserverlibrary.pl and update the source files.  Add inline comments throughout the code to clarify logic, variable usage, and complex operations. Document the purpose of global/static variables where they are used. Apply this style to every function: add a Doxygen-style docstring at the top, and inline comments for complex logic or important variable usage. Document all parameters, return values, and any error/exception/exit conditions.

 

Also change the "walgreensserver.pl and walgreensserverlibrary.pl" to the name(s) of your classes/code ....


==================================

The prompt that would produce this source documenation is : Forget everything you may have done or learned with this repository today. Do not attempt to build or compile any code, that is done on the CICD runner.
Explain the complete purpose and functionality in detail of the code in all .cpp and .hpp files and add to a markdown document named PurposeAndFunctionality.md. Also add Doxygen-style docstrings to every function and method, describing their purpose, parameters, return values, and exception conditions for all .cpp and .hpp files and update the source files. Add inline comments throughout the code to clarify logic, variable usage, and complex operations. Document the purpose of global/static variables where they are used. Apply this style to every function: add a Doxygen-style docstring at the top, and inline comments for complex logic or important variable usage. Document all parameters, return values, and any error/exception/exit conditions. Ignore any file in the no.commit directory or where the name contains no.commit or is found in a no.commit folder. Continue until all files are documented, do not require any confirmations or ask if you should continue. Please only add documentation comments, do not modify any existing code, do not add any new functions or structures, keep all the original code exactly as it was.
